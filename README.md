# Supervised-Model-Cup
This notebook tested the performance of the following scikit-learn models: Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perception, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Random Forest Classifier in classifying whether a person has thyroid or not based on the dataset provided (annthyroid-training.csv).  Each model’s performance has been evaluated using the F1 Score.  

NOTE: This notebook was used for a homework — we were tasked to choose 1 model out of the previously mentioned models and tweak its hyper parameters so we can get the best F1 score.

For the purposes of the homework, the formula for F1 as well as other formulas from the confusion matrix have been specified.
